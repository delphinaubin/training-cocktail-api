Training cocktail api
===
I use this repository to give technical interviews.

It exposed a simple api with 2 endpoints: 

The first one returns a list of cocktails. `https://training-cocktail-api.vercel.app/api/cocktails`

The second one can retrieve an ingredient by id `https://training-cocktail-api.vercel.app/api/ingredients/{id}`

Feel free to use it ðŸ˜Š
